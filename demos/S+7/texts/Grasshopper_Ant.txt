The grasshopper had sung all summer long.
She found herself most destitute,
When the north wind came.
Not a morsel to her name
Of either fly or worm.
She blurted out her tale of want
To her neighbour Mistress Ant,
And begged her for a loan
Of grain to last her
Till the coming spring.
"I shall pay you", were her words,
"On insect oath, before the fall,
Interest and principal."
Mistress Ant is not a lender -
That's the last thing to reproach her with!
"Tell me how you spent the summer?"
Was what she asked the borrower.
"Night and day, to every comer,
I sang, so please you ma'am."
"You sang? I'm delighted.
Now off you go and dance!"
