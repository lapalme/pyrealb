# *pyrealb* - A Python Bilingual Text Realizer

*Version 3.2.2 - April 2025*

*pyrealb* is a Python adaptation of the JavaScript [**jsRealB**](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/jsRealB) 
text realizer with the same constituent and dependency syntax notation. 
It facilitates its integration within Python applications by simply adding

	from pyrealb import *

[Online documentation](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/pyrealb/documentation.html?lang=en)

Version 3.0.0 was a major code reorganization, but without any new feature, to clearly separate language dependent 
parts from the language independent ones. This organization is described  [here](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/pyrealb/Realizer-Architecture.html) .

The use of pyrealb for [Bilingual Data-to-text generation is described in this document](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14808.pdf).

## Installing the distribution package from PyPI

    pip install pyrealb

**Caution**: do not forget the `b` at the end of `pyrealb`. On _PyPI_, there is an unrelated package `pyreal` _for evaluating and deploying human readable machine learning explanations_.

## Upgrading the version 

    pip install pyrealb --upgrade

## Building and installing the package from the sources

1. `cd` into this directory (with `pyproject.toml` file)
2. Build the distribution package `python3 -m build`
3. Install with `python3 -m pip install .`

## First realization tests at the Python 3 prompt

1. `from pyrealb import *`
2. `loadEn()` 
3. `print(S(Pro("I").g("f"),VP(V("say"),"hello",PP(P("to"),NP(D("the"),N("world"))))))`
4. this should print `She says hello to the world.`
5. `print(root(V("say").t("ps"),subj(Pro("him").c("nom")),comp(N("goodbye"))).typ({"neg":True}))`
6. this should print `He did not say goodbye.`

## Use pyrealb in a _Jupyter notebook_

- Thru *Binder*, load one of these links: [English](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lapalme/pyrealb-jupyter/HEAD?labpath=pyrealb-en.ipynb)  [French](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lapalme/pyrealb-jupyter/HEAD?labpath=pyrealb-fr.ipynb) 
- From a terminal:
  - if the Python notebook module is not already installed, do: `pip3 install notebook` and watch a lot of loading...
  - `cd Notebooks`
  - `python3 -m notebook`  this should open a browser window with links to the [English](pyrealb-en.ipynb) and [French](pyrealb-fr.ipynb) notebooks 

# Directories

* [`src/pyrealb`](./src/pyrealb)
    * `__init__.py` : import classes and functions and export relevant symbols. 
    * `Constituent.py`: *Constituent* is the top class for methods shared between *Phrase*s and *Terminal*s 
    * `ConstituentEn.py`, `ConstituentFr.py` : English and French specific processing of `Constituent`
    * `Dependent.py` : subclass of *Constituent* for creating complex phrases using dependencies
    * `DependentEn.py`, `DependentFr.py` : English and French specific processing of `Dependent`
    * `lemmatize.py` : function for building the lemmata maps
    * `Lexicon.py`: class to access lexicon entries and syntactic rules
    * `LICENSE.txt`: Apache 2.0 License
    * `NonTerminalEn.py`, `NonTerminalFr.py` : language dependent processing common to `Phrase` and `Dependent`
    * `Number.py` : utility functions for dealing with number formatting
    * `Phrase.py` : subclass of *Constituent* for creating complex phrases
    * `PhraseEn.py`, `PhraseFr.py` : English and French specific processing of `Phrase` 
    * `Terminal.py` : subclass of *Constituent* for creating a single unit (most often a single word)
    * `TerminalEn.py`, `TerminalFr.py` : English and French specific processing of `Terminal`
    * `utils.py`  : some useful functions
* [`./src/pyrealb/data`](./src/pyrealb/data): these resources are identical to the corresponding files in *jsRealB*
    * `LICENSE.txt` : Creative Common license
    * `lexicon-en.json` : English lexicon (33,932 entries) in json format
    * `rule-en.js` : English conjugation and declension tables
    * `lexicon-fr.json` : French lexicon (52,547 entries) in json format
    * `rule-fr.js` : French conjugation and declension tables 
    * `lexicon-en.jsonrnc, lexicon-fr.jsonrnc` : json-rnc schemas for the lexicons 
    * `lexicon-en.jsonrnc.json, lexicon-fr.jsonrnc.json` : standard JSON schemas corresponding to the json-rnc schemas for the lexicons; these files are created by the validation process.

**_Nota bene_:**

1. In the following directories, the `__init__.py` file is used to set the appropriate search path for  *pyrealb* functions; this ensures that the current Python source files are used for execution and testing. 
2. Some directories include `markup.py` which should be loaded using `pip`. Unfortunately I never managed to make this "piped" version work, it does not import the name `oneliner`although it should. It works only if the file is in the local directory.

* [`docs`](./docs): The html and image files should be copied at `http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/pyrealb/` which is used for convenient web access.
    
    * English and French documentation
        * `documentation.html` : generated documentation **DO NOT EDIT directly**  [Online version](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/pyrealb/documentation.html?lang=en)
        * `documentation.py`: Python program for generating `documentation.html` using `markup.py`
        * `style.css`: style sheet for the documentation
        * `userinfos.py`: definitions of variables containing the examples
        * `user.js`  : Python helper script.
    
    * Supplements to the documentation for specific aspects. Edit a *Markdown* (`.md)` file and use the `Makefile` for generating the *html* version.
        * `Hacking-pyrealb.md` : tricks of the trade for dynamic constituent structure modification 
        * `Lexicon-Format-en.md, Lexicon-Format-fr.md` : language specific detailed documentation about lexicon entries.
        * `Realizer-Architecture.md` : description of the class organisation of the *jsRealB*/*pyrealb* ecosystem
        * `Makefile` : 
            *  `make all` : update the documentation after changing `documentation.py` or any *Markdown* file
            * `make export` : list the files that should be present on the web consultation directory
    
* [`IDE`](./IDE) : Integrated Development Environment 

    * `ide.py`: built on the Python *read-eval-print loop*, it imports *pyrealb* to get the realization of an expression, to consult the lexicon, the conjugation and declension tables. It is also possible to get a *lemmatization*: i.e. the *pyrealb* expression corresponding to a form. 
    * `README.html`: documentation and examples

    *Nota bene*: The [evaluation demo of *jsRealB*](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/demos/Evaluation/index.html) is more convenient than this IDE to develop *pyrealb* expressions as both programs share the same formalism. The *jsRealB* demo provides an editor and access to the lexicons and  rules.

* [Notebooks](./NoteBooks) : Jupyter notebooks (in English and French) with can be used as an executable introduction to *pyrealb*

* [`tests`](./tests) : unit tests of special features of *pyrealb* in both French and English. They are designed to launched with `pytest`. Files have the pattern `test_*_{en|fr}.py`. 

    * `README.md`: more details on the organisation and use of the test files
    * `test_all.sh` : run this file in a terminal to run all test files of the directory

# Demos

* `99bottlesofbeer/99bottlesofbeer.py` : simple generation of a classic repetitive text in English.

# For the maintainer mainly
## Updating package version on PyPI 

see [this tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

These steps take for granted that the password for PyPI has already been given...

1. Update version number in `setup.cfg` (it should be the same as `python_version` in `src/pyrealb/utils.py` and at the beginning of this document). 
2. Run `docs/documentation.py` to update the version number in `docs/documentation.html`
3. Commit pyrealb on GitHub
4. `cd` into the directory with the `pyproject.toml` file (the same as this `README.md`)
5. Build the distribution package  
       `python3 -m build`
6. Upload to PyPi the last version I.J.K
      `twine upload dist/*-I.J.K.*`
7. Install new version from PyPI  
    `python3 -m pip install pyrealb --upgrade`

## Useful trick for debugging with breaking point and tracing in PyCharm
1. add `pyrealb` expression to debug at the end of `demo/dev_example/dev_example.py`
2. comment the line calling `testPreviousExamples()`
3. debug `demo/dev_example/dev_example.py`
