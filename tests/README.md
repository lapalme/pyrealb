# Unit tests for pyrealb

This directory contains unit tests to be launched by `pytest`.

These files were generated by a Python script from the examples used by my previous ad-hoc test mechanism except for `test_json_fns.py` which was created manually.

Each file can be launched separately using `pytest` _<code>file</code>_ or within _PyCharm_

**Use** `test_all.sh` for launching all tests which executes `pytest` on each file. 
**DO NOT** use `pytest` on all the files because, the language context is not set correctly. As I am a `pytest` novice, this could probably be fixed with an appropriate _fixture_, I leave this as an _exercise to the reader_.

Each test file begins with

```python
import os, sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..','src')))
```

This is to ensure that the tests are performed on the last version of the source of *pyrealb* and not on the published package on PyPi.

There are other tests examples in `../demos/dev_example/dev_example.py`  some of which overlap with a few in the files of this directory.
